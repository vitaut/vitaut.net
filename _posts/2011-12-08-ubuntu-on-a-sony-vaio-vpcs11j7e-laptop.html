<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<div class='post'>
  <p>Today I finally got my SONY VAIO VPCS11J7E laptop delivered after a
  warranty repair. They replaced a few parts and thoroughly cleaned the laptop.
  Now it looks as new apart from a small crack on flimsy plastic around the
  hinges (I rejected their generous offer to replace the plastic for 200
  quid.)</p>

  <p>I immediately wiped out Windows 7 and (other) junkware that they had put
  on my laptop eating up a huge chunk of my precious SSD space, and installed
  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> Oneiric Ocelot. Due to this rare
  opportunity of having a fresh install of Ubuntu I decided to do some tests to
  see how well this laptop's hardware is supported in this OS both out of the
  box and with additional drivers. So I ran the complete set of tests from the
  <a href="https://launchpad.net/checkbox">System Testing</a> utility. The full
  report is available <a href=
  "/files/test-results">here</a>.</p>

  <p>As you can see from <a href="/files/test-results">the test results</a> most
  laptop's hardware is supported out of the box. It includes graphics that
  works both with open source and proprietary drivers, networking, camera, card
  reader, etc. So I will only focus on the few things that are not working and
  how to fix them. Note that although optical drive test fails the drive itself
  works perfectly. However the default disk burning software (<a href=
  "http://projects.gnome.org/brasero//index.html">Brasero</a>) has some
  problems with it, like being unable to eject disks. So I recommend using
  <a href="http://www.k3b.org/">K3b</a> instead.</p><strong>Microphone</strong>

  <p>To get rid of the annoying cracking noise reported <a href=
  "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/787410">here</a>
  add the following line to <code>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</code>:</p>

{% highlight text %}
options snd-hda-intel position_fix=2
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now restart the system and enjoy the clear sound of your voice. <strong>
  Brightness control</strong></p>

  <p>Download the latest version of the <a href=
  "https://github.com/guillaumezin/nvidiabl">nvidiabl</a> driver (version 0.72
  of the driver is available <a href=
  "https://github.com/downloads/guillaumezin/nvidiabl/nvidiabl-dkms_0.72_all.deb">
  here</a>) and install it:</p>

<pre class="terminal"><code>$ sudo dpkg -i nvidiabl-dkms_0.72_all.deb</code></pre>
It enables the control of laptop backlight connected to NVIDIA chip using
the <code>/sys/class/backlight</code> interface.

  <p>To make the brightness control Fn keys work get the required scripts from
  <a href="https://github.com/guillaumezin/nvidiabl">nvidiabl</a> repository
  and copy them to <code>/etc</code>:</p>
<pre class="terminal">
<code>$ git clone https://github.com/guillaumezin/nvidiabl.git
$ sudo cp -R nvidiabl/scripts/etc/* /etc
</code></pre>

<p><strong>External monitor</strong></p>

  <p>To enable external monitor with proprietary NVIDIA drivers:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open NVIDIA X Server Settings.</li>

    <li>Go to "X Server Display Configuration".</li>

    <li>Click "Detect Displays".</li>

    <li>Select the external display and choose TwinView in
    "Configuration".</li>

    <li>Click Apply.</li>

    <li>Click "Save to X Configuration File" if you want to make this
    configuration permanent.</li>
  </ol>

  </div>Alternatively set the following options in the Screen section of
  <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> and restart the X server:

Section "Screen"
    ...
    Option "TwinView" "1"
    Option "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" "DFP-0"
    Option "metamodes" "DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, CRT: nvidia-auto-select +1366+0"
    ...
EndSection
{% endhighlight %}
